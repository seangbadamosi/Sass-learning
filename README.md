# Sass-Learning
### 1 Lesson 1 | Variables
* If you know a bit of Js then you should be familar with variables
* To create a varible you write a dollar sign (\$) then give it a name then you can assign it a css property-value eg

```{css}
    $primary-btn: red;

    a{
        background-color:$primary-btn;
    }
```
* It helps to avoid repetition if there is a problem with a specific code you simply change the value of the variable, and any tag with a matching variable value will change 
* When crearting a variable you write at the top of the scss like line 1, 2 and 3
