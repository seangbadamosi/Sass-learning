# Sass-Learning
### Lesson 1 | Variables
* If you know a bit of Js then you should be familar with variables
* To create a varible you write a dollar sign (\$) then give it a name then you can assign it a css property-value eg

```{scss}
    $primary-btn: red;

    a{
        background-color:$primary-btn;
    }
```
* It helps to avoid repetition if there is a problem with a specific code you simply change the value of the variable, and any tag with a matching variable value will change 
* When crearting a variable you write at the top of the scss like line 1, 2 and 3
 
 ### Lesson 2 | Nesting
 * it helps reflect the html structure and makes the styling more readable and easy to maintain this can be done in plain css
 * Related styles are grouped together, making the code more organized eg
 ```{scss}
    header{
    background-color: lightblue;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    color: $textColor;
    height: 15vh;

    button{
        background-color:  $primaryBtn;
        transition: 2s;
        border-radius: 10px;
        width: 10vw;
        height: 6vh;
        text-transform: capitalize;
        
        &:hover{
            background-color: red;
        }
        
        &::after{
            content: 'ooo';
        }
    }
}

 ```
* this is how it looks like with nesting 
* nesting allows you to put slectors into one another creating a type of hierarchy and making it more readable
* we should be cautious not to nest more than three levels that is greatgrandparents, grandparents,  parents and child we should avoid ðŸ‘Ž
